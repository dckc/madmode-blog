# Discovering Eleventy - A Static Site Generator

Today, I stumbled upon Eleventy (11ty), a simpler static site generator. Its flexibility and ease of use immediately caught my attention. Unlike some other static site generators, Eleventy doesn't push you into a specific framework. It allows you to use multiple template languages in a single project, which is pretty cool.

I'm excited to dive deeper into Eleventy and possibly use it for future projects. Stay tuned for more updates as I explore this tool further!
