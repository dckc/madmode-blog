# Exploring Python Type Hinting

Python 3.5 introduced type hinting, a feature that allows developers to add optional static typing to their Python code. Today, I spent some time exploring this feature and its potential benefits.

Type hinting can make your code more readable and self-documenting. It also enables better tooling support, including more accurate autocompletion and type checking.

Here's a simple example:

```python
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

While Python remains dynamically typed at runtime, these hints can be incredibly useful during development. I'm looking forward to incorporating type hinting into my future Python projects!
