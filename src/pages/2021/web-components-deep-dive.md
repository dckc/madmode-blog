# A Deep Dive into Web Components

Web Components have been around for a while, but I've only recently started to explore their potential. These are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create reusable custom elements with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code.

The three main technologies that make up Web Components are:

1. Custom Elements
2. Shadow DOM
3. HTML Templates

I've been experimenting with creating my own custom elements, and I'm impressed by how they can be used to create modular, reusable components without the need for a heavy framework.

Here's a simple example of a custom element:

```javascript
class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);
```

I'm excited about the possibilities this opens up for creating more maintainable and interoperable web applications. Expect to see more Web Component experiments from me in the future!
