# Exploring WebAssembly

Today, I started exploring WebAssembly (Wasm), a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. WebAssembly is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

What excites me about WebAssembly is its potential to bring near-native performance to web applications. It's not meant to replace JavaScript, but to complement it, allowing developers to leverage both technologies for optimal performance.

I've been experimenting with compiling a simple C function to WebAssembly and calling it from JavaScript. Here's a basic example:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

After compiling this to WebAssembly and setting up the JavaScript glue code, I can call this function from JavaScript just like any other function.

I'm looking forward to diving deeper into WebAssembly and exploring its potential for performance-critical web applications. Stay tuned for more updates on my WebAssembly journey!
