title: Web Directions North ski trip was a blast!
updated: 2010-06-02


After my second morning of skiing with just me and my iPod, I was glad to find a message waiting on my mobile phone as I rode the lift:<br />
<blockquote>Lunch at 10 mile station 1230</blockquote><br />
<a href="http://north.webdirections.org/"><img align="right" alt="" height="68" src="http://static1.webdirections.org/webdirections_north/wdn10/wp-content/themes/conf-theme/images/logo.png" title="Web Directions North" width="248" /></a>It's from Jason, who I met for the first time on this <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/">Web Directions North</a> trip--two days of <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/program">technical conference in Denver</a> and two days of <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/news/internet-explorer-8-ski-trip">skiing in Breckenridge</a>. Lunch with him sounds great! Now... where is 10 mile station and how do I get there?<br />

<br />
It was noon by the time I got off the lift, so I asked the ski patrol guide. "Blue slopes," I said when she asked what level of skier I am; i.e. intermediate. To get there in time, she suggested taking Frosty's Freeway (an advanced intermediate blue/black trail) to the E chair lift and then down Upper Lehman to Ten Mile Station.<br />
<br />
After meeting that challenge, I declared victory using <a href="http://brightkite.com/">brightkite</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Made it to ten mile from peak 8 right on time<br />

Brightkite is one of the conference sponsors; based in Denver, they provide a location-aware social networking service. My son Justin had asked me to tell him about skiing, so I figured that was an excuse to try it out and take some notes:<br />
<blockquote>Loved that run... golden something? Short line @ c chair<br />

Lunch at Ten Mile Station was great. I was so hungry that even the crazy prices couldn't keep me from grabbing everything in sight.<br />
<br />
Jason said he was headed for peak 10, "the southernmost part of Breckenridge, servicing mainly difficult and a substantial amount of intermediate terrain," according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breckenridge_Ski_Resort">Wikipedia</a>. I couldn't decide whether to take on that sort of challenge after a day and a half of skiing. When Jason said we'd pause to take pictures, that settled it for me. So here I am getting ready for a pretty steep run:<br />

<br />
After a few more runs, it was...<br />
<blockquote>Time to give back the skis. Sigh.<br />

But that wasn't the end of the fun; Microsoft sponsored an aprés ski where we all enjoyed some food and drink and music and chat:<br />
