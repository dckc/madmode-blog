As an open source advocate, I initially bristle at this...

> These sectors may be particularly vulnerable to cyberattack because
> they rely on open-source software or hardware, third-party
> utilities, and interconnected networks

but it is a factor: it lets people hook their stuff up to
interconnected networks without going up the management chain to
authorize a purchase.

Meanwhile, it's going to get worse before it gets better, from every
indication I see. This sort of accountability might actually be
healthy:

I can imagine demand for software audits will increase as a result.
Perhaps that provides an opportunity, since object capability
discipline facilitates software audits. The effort to get the value of
ocap recognized widely in the security and compliance community is
daunting, but I sure hope it happens.

I managed to do a bit. I was invited to speak to a small C.S. class at
a nearby college while the regular professor was away. I took the
opportunity to review and re-package two of Mark Miller's talks from
2011, prefaced with the "giant bags of mostly water" slides. It was
fun!
