This year I was invited to a [Blockchain meets Object Capabilities
panel][SFO] in San Francisco July 3 and the [RChain developer retreat][SLC]
in Park City Nov 12-17. Leaving Park City was... _interesting_.

My flight to San Francisco was funded from the [$30 that I put into
Ethereum][eth] in mid 2016--as an educational expense, I thought; I
hardly expected to square my investment.

Jorge Lopez of [Gravity][] hosted long-time capabilities leaders Mark
Miller, Zooko Wilcox, and Brian Warner as well as Arthur Breitman of
[Tezos][]. Zooko also represented [Zcash][].

Brian gave a great summary of the bitcoin market forces but I was too
engrossed in the event to take notes; the one quote I managed to write
down was "Satoshi is probably in the room."


_Aside: [Sandstorm Oasis](https://oasis.sandstorm.io/) let me export
the grain I took my notes in even though my subscription had
lapsed. That's pretty cool._

The evening before the panel, @zooko gave a [shout][z84] out to my
[awesome-ocap][] list, and in a [reply from @robertobrien][ro], I
discovered [RChain's Namespace Logic][ns].

I saw Mike Stay's name, which was familiar from [cap-talk][]
discussion, on some of the citations in the RChain Architecture
document, and asked him some questions in email. Before long I was
contributing [little tweaks][PR40] to the code and wrangled an
invitation to the developer retreat.

Again, I was too engrossed to take good notes, but they made
[recordings of the main sessions][v16].

The RChain goals are ambitious, to say the least: "content delivery at
the scale of Facebook and transactions at the speed of Visa." Not to
mention a an "e pluribus unum 2.0, a new center on a scale-invariant
axis reconciling the wisdom of collective and the wisdom of the
individual" for collaborating on problems such as global warming.  An
[interview with Greg Meredith][GM] from the [January RChain
announcement][jan11] filled in a lot of the background for me.

Nash and the gang did an amazing job hosting. We had dinner out most
nights and breakfast in the houses in the morning, and it's a tough
call which was better.

On the last day, after a mind-blowing week, we were all lounging
around, zoned out on our phones, when we noticed the snow. For some,
it was their first snowstorm... nice and pretty. Then Nash snapped
us out of it: "**Get off the mountain now** before they close
the pass and you miss your flights!" As we were getting in the
big rental SUV, I asked, "Have you driven in snow before?" and since
she hadn't, the keys passed to me.

The drive out was a little hairy, but
[Vlad](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir) shared some tunes and
we all got to know each other a little better.
