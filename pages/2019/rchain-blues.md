Working on RChain was fun for a while, but I am no longer be
comfortable with the RChain Cooperative's business practices.

I am inclined to keep my distance until I see

  - quarterly financials on time ("no later than 20 days after the
    quarter ends" per IOB 1 from the [2018 annual meeting][1])
  - the [board carry out IOB 4 member participation in
    governance][4]
  - [timely board agendas and minutes][11]
  - some [details re Barcelona][14]
  - this open-source cooperative [divest any significant
    interest in a proprietary audio codec license][9]

The story of how [RChain's CoinMarketCap rank][cmc] fell from 30 to
over 200 in 2018 would take more energy to tell than I have just now,
but to emphasize why something as supposedly mundane as quarterly
financial reports has me so uncomfortable...

I assumed since I got involved in Nov 2017 that any organization that
had raised $30M from investors would have someone keeping books, so
that producing a balance sheets or cashflow statements was a one-click
task... I assumed that people were busy and they just hadn't bothered
to click that button and share the results.

I should have known this was yet another case where the web reflects
reality.

In the board meeting of July 23, 2018, when they decided to spend tens
of millions of dollars on a proprietary audio codec, they _did not
know how much money the coop actually had_, according to Meredith at
the [Oct 2018 annual meeting][18].

Some new board members were elected and tried to improve corporate
governance, but one by one they reached a point of diminishing returns
and moved on to other things.

After the April [Barcelona incident][bar20], one member put it this way:

> ... it became near impossible to responsibly put one's reputation on
> the line for this project.

I attempted to steer member engagement in a useful direction in a
[Special Meeting 19A][sm19a] process; it was a long-shot and not much
resulted from it, but I did manage to get over 100 members on record
thanking those who had served on the board since the October annual
meeting, trying to right the ship:

> Whereas Barry Cynamon, Mark Pui, and Kevin Goldstein served with
> distinction on the RChain Cooperative board, let us thank them for
> their service.
