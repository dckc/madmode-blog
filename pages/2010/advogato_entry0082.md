I've been telling people about this idea for years: a camera that you just wear all the time--part of your glasses, say--and then when you see something cool--like the three deer that crossed the road as I was driving my boys to school this morning, you just hit a button to say "keep that!" or "send it to mom" or "post it to youtube".<br />
<br />
Well, the future is here. I didn't even have to go looking for it. It just fell on my head (well, in my inbox) a few minutes after I was searching for some gizmo or other.<br />

It's a souped-up bluetooth headset rather than souped-up glasses. Where I imagined keeping the last 15 minutes or so, this thing keeps <i>5 hours</i> of recent history, and <i>4 hours</i> of saved video. And it integrates with smartphones for sharing. But the "Instant Clip" button is the exact feature I had in mind:<br />
<blockquote><h3>Looxcie Hands-Free Camcorder</h3><ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"><li style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Wearable camcorder continuously videos everything you see</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Instant Clip button lets you retroactively save 30-second clips</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Review and edit video using your compatible smartphone</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Share video instantly via Facebook, YouTube, or email</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Automatically stores up to five hours of footage</li>
</ul></blockquote>I just drained the piggy-bank on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TXSKNE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=danconnolly&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003TXSKNE">Samsung Vibrant Android Phone</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=danconnolly&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003TXSKNE" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />, so I won't be an early adopter on this one. But I hope to stay tuned for reviews and I look forward to the day when they're available on craigslist or ebay.<br />

I wonder how many patents are involved in this thing. I can't believe I didn't publish the idea before this hit my inbox. I spent over a decade mentoring staff at W3C to publish early and often, and I formed good habits as far as getting any code I write out on the public Internet, but not so with blog items, yet. Live and learn.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1117883616379032462-8295372433647640022?l=www.madmode.com' alt='' /></div>
