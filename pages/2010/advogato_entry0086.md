Our home phone service is provided by a VoIP provider, <a href="http://www.viatalk.com/">ViaTalk</a>. I have a VoIP client, <a href="http://sipdroid.org/">sipdroid</a>, on my smart phone. When the phone rings and caller-id shows a call I want to take, I'd like to take it on my smart phone. Is this too much to ask?<br />
<div><br />
</div><div>Evidently so: when I have my smart phone register to answer calls on the home line, incoming calls no longer ring the land-lines in the house. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a>&nbsp;is complex enough to make configuring softphones a nightmare; for all this complexity, it can't register two devices for the same phone line at the same time? Or is the limitation somewhere else?</div><div><br />
</div><div><i>p.s. If anyone knows how to solve this puzzle, I'd also like to forward caller ID to my phone as instant messages; I'm happy to write a little SIP to XMPP proxy in python, given the necessary clues about the protocol.</i></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1117883616379032462-313607353353007924?l=www.madmode.com' alt='' /></div>
