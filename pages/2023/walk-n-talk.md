walk-n-talk?

That's short for: would you like to talk with me as I take my dog on a walk?

When the pandemic hit, I traded in my commute to [KU Med Center](/label/cube%20life/) for a walk with my dog Mojo.

While we're out walking, I like to talk with a friend, family member, or some colleagues.
Mojo really likes it because I lose track of time and she gets to smell everything more.

Usually it's a plain 1-1 phone call (or [signal call](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060492-Voice-or-Video-Calling)). But
sometiems it's a group thing. It's great to talk-real time with
colleagues around the globe, but sometimes the tech reminds
you that there's nothing like being there:

 - Zoom: the dominant player. Pretty reliable
 - [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/): based on open tech.
   Also reliable in my experience. The main drawback is that recording
isn't as well integrated.
 - Discord voice: disappointing, especially since
I gather the reason it was created was to provide a voice
side-channel for gaming.
