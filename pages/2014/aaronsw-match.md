As we mark the new year, I'm [right there with Andy Baio][waxpancake]:

> For me, 2013 will always be the year we lost Aaron. One of the

In [Aaron's account][Swartz02] of the 2002 Creative Commons license
launch, he wrote:

If 2013 is the year we lost Aaron, let 2014 be the year we pick up
where he left off. In the [words of Lawrence Lessig][Lessig13]:

> ... our fight was his fight. And [...] while only he was Aaron
> Swartz, we are all now Aaron Swartz.

Every time you go to a movie, think about the impact on [free culture][]:

> * Creativity and innovation always builds on the past.
> * The past always tries to control the creativity that builds upon it.
> * Free societies enable the future by limiting this power of the past.
> * Ours is less and less a free society.

I'd like to see lots of other people **take
[this pledge][aaronsw-match]**, but I've been matching my movie spending
with donations in Aaron's memory (to the EFF, [rootstrikers][rs],
etc.) for about a year now, and I plan to continue regardless of how
many people join me. I picked 26 becase that's how old Aaron was when
we lost him:
