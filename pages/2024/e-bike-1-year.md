I wasn't sure how long it would last when I replaced my car with an ebike. After a year, I have not once wished I had my own car.

When one of my kids moved out last spring, I gave him my car, a 2006 Infinity G35X. Shopping for a replacement was a depressing prospect. I had gotten a great deal on that G35 in 2019 (paid about $5k, including $1.5k in repairs), and I had little hope of finding another deal like that, especially with the [impact of the pandemic on car prices](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/18/1163278082/car-prices-used-cars-electric-vehicles-pandemic).

> Retail used-vehicle prices now average $26,510.

With new car prices averaging $49K, I started to think I might as well get a Tesla. But as I looked closer, I realized they're not so good for the planet after all.

With several e-bike models around $1,000, I figured I could hire a car when I need one and still save a lot.

## Heybike Ranger

I like the fat tire style. I picked a [Heybike Ranger Electric Bike](https://www.heybike.com/products/heybike-ranger-step-thru-electric-bike) ([from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CYC185VD/)).

Assembly took about an hour, with a few frustrations here and there as the instructions and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZd_xIp8QZg) didn't exactly match what came in the box.

## Riding to shops and restaurants

Feeling the wind and sun as I ride to nearby shops and such really is exhilarating.

Full disclosure:

- Mine wasn't the only car in the house. I still have access to my wife's car when she is not using it.
- I work from home, so commuting is not an issue.

I have some of the usual accessories:

- [BriskMore Bike Handlebar Mirror](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092QKJNPM/)
- [Via Velo Heavy Duty Bicycle U-Lock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KD9AQ92/) - the U-Lock is a pretty secure option, except that sometimes I don't bother. Plus, it rattles when I ride. So I'm considering one of the motion-activated alarms.
- [Lamicall Bike Phone Holder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085DMV7XD/) - Google Maps has pretty good bike directions.
- [ROCKBROS Bike Trunk Bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPXTCTK/) - I tried a couple different kinds of panniers and even a milk crate. But they get in the way when I'm just trying to get from here to there, and getting them on and off is a bother. So this bag is just right: I keep it on all the time, but I only unfold the panniers when I need them for groceries or the like.

## Folding

Lifting the 70lb bike is a bit of a challenge, but folding is especially useful if I bike one way and get a ride the other; it even fits in the back of a Prius!

## Brakes: squeaky or mushy

The brakes squeaked when I first got it. I found an adjustment to address that, but it made the brakes so mushy I could hardly stop. So I live with a bit of squeak.

## Speed: 25mph

Ok, so it only goes that fast downhill. But even uphill, going 15mph+ without pedaling hard sure is nice :)

The top speed is fast enough that my eyes water. So rather than one of the bike helmets we've had in the garage for decades, I now use a [VICTGOAL Bike Helmet with Detachable Magnetic Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P5LB7Y3/). Bonus: works as sunglasses too.

## Cold weather riding

Going that fast does make it feel colder. But with the right gear, even riding below freezing is not bad. [LINGSFIRE Bike Handlebar Mittens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCP3MPWZ/) are cozy.

I haven't tried it in the rain, much.

## Range?

I don't know what the range is. My trips are typically a mile or two. I averaged 7.7miles per week over the year. I think my longest trip was about 5 miles each way. It was to music practice, with my guitar on my back :)
